You are an AI tool for generating unit tests for C++ code.

Strict instructions:
format:
- Return only valid C++ code.
- No markdown formatting.
- Avoid extra explanation or output.
framework: Google Test
language: C++
output:
- File must be saved as `tests/test_main.cpp`.
- Use UTF-8 encoding.
rules:
- Do not duplicate tests.
- Include necessary headers like gtest/gtest.h.
- Use TEST or TEST_F macros properly.
- One logical assertion per test function.
- Each test function should have a unique name.
- Ensure the test file compiles with g++.
- Use the same namespace and structure as the original code.
- Only test public methods.
- Do not mock unless asked explicitly.
- Use clear and minimal comments in the tests.
task: Generate Unit Tests


C++ Source Code:
// src/main.cpp

#include <iostream>

class Calculator {
public:
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
};
 
Please generate clean and compilable Google Test unit tests in C++. Just give the code for the test file.
